Now that our API can add food objects, let's retrieve them from the foods dictionary.

In this Bite you will write two endpoints to do so:

- read_foods() to retrieve all foods

- read_food() to retrieve a single food by id (i.e. the key in the foods dictionary). For this you will need what FastAPI calls a path parameter.

After completing this Bite, you will be halfway there with the CRUD (create-read-update-delete) of foods. In the next Bite we'll have you implement the update and delete endpoints.

Good luck!
